In summary, one of the most common reasons people want to photograph in black and white is a certain timeless quality of photography, it is also a challenge because the lack of color makes photographers think and find creative solutions in a variety of ways. A black and white photo surpasses reality by transforming it into a sphere that is sometimes pure abstraction. Monochrome color is a powerful means of deconstructing a scene, and reduces it to its primary role of line, shape, and texture, which are diffused into colors.

Due to this, black and white photos enable both the photographer and the viewer to discover the basic elements of visual appeal and find well-composed images.
